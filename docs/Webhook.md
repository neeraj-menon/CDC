# Webhook Email Trigger Plan

## Goal
Trigger an email notification via webhook whenever a CDC (Change Data Capture) event is received from the Pulsar topic.

---

## Overview
- **Trigger:** CDC event received by the Python consumer (`consume.py`).
- **Action:** Send an HTTP POST request (webhook) containing event details.
- **Webhook Handler:** A service that receives the webhook and sends an email with event information.

---

## Steps

### 1. Modify the Consumer
- Update `consume.py` to POST event data to a webhook endpoint on each CDC event.
- Use Python's `requests` library for HTTP POST.
- Payload should include relevant event fields (e.g., message ID, key, value).

### 2. Webhook Service
- Create a simple webhook handler (can be in Python Flask, FastAPI, or Node.js Express).
- On receiving a POST request, extract event data from the payload.
- Send an email to the target address using an email API (SendGrid, Mailgun, SMTP, etc.).

### 3. Email Configuration
- Store email credentials and recipient addresses securely (environment variables or config file).
- Format the email body to include CDC event details for clarity.

### 4. Deployment
- Deploy the webhook handler (locally, on a server, or as a cloud function).
- Ensure the endpoint is accessible to the consumer.
- Test the full flow: CDC event → webhook → email.

## Example Architecture

```
[Debezium/Postgres] → [Pulsar] → [consume.py] → [Webhook Service] → [Email]
```

---

## Security & Reliability Notes
- Use authentication for the webhook endpoint (e.g., secret tokens).
- Add retry logic in the consumer for failed webhook calls.
- Log all webhook requests and email sends for traceability.

---

## Optional Enhancements
- Support multiple recipients or dynamic email routing.
- Add filtering/logic to trigger emails only for certain event types.
- Use HTML email templates for better formatting.

---

## Next Steps
1. Update `consume.py` to POST to a webhook.
2. Build and deploy the webhook email handler.
3. Test the end-to-end workflow.
4. Add security and reliability features as needed.
